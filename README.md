## ✨ Key Features (Assignment 4 - Final Version)

### 🎯 **NEW: Interactive Learning Journey Timeline**
- Visual progression timeline showing skill development over time
- Animated skill progress bars that fill when scrolled into view
- Four major milestones: Web Development, Programming Languages, Mobile Development, and Advanced Web Applications
- Interactive hover effects and smooth animations
- Progress percentages for each technology skill
- Responsive design adapting to all screen sizes

### 🔗 1. External API Integration
- Uses the **GitHub REST API** to dynamically fetch and display my latest repositories
- Includes loading states, graceful error handling, and animated GitHub cards
- Reload button for fetching updated repositories

### 🧠 2. Complex Application Logic
- AI Message Enhancer (Professional, Friendly, Concise, Grammar Fix)
- Smooth scrolling and fade-in animations using IntersectionObserver
- Name personalization modal with greeting updates
- Real-time session timer
- GitHub repo reload button
- Contact form validation with interactive notifications
- Timeline progress bar animations triggered on scroll

### 💾 3. State Management
- Stores visitor name in `localStorage`
- Saves theme preference (light/dark)
- Maintains UI states even after refresh
- Modal visibility logic based on stored values

### 🚀 4. Performance Optimization
- Deferred JavaScript execution (`<script defer>`)
- Image compression for hero/projects images
- Lazy rendering using IntersectionObserver
- Cached DOM elements for faster lookups
- Removed unused CSS and minimized repetitive blocks
- Efficient API request handling (limit to 6 repos)
- Browser performance logged on page load

Result: **Page loads in under 3 seconds** on typical devices.

### 🤖 5. AI Innovation
AI tools supported development by:
- Improving logic structure
- Suggesting design refinements
- Debugging DOM/event issues
- Optimizing performance
- Creating the timeline animation logic
- Assisting in documentation writing
