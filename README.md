# 🌐 Shatha Alharbi – Portfolio (Assignment 3)

## 📸 Project Overview
A fully responsive and interactive personal portfolio website developed as part of **Assignment 3**.  
This version includes advanced JavaScript logic, state management, external API integration, performance improvements, and responsible AI-assisted development.

## ✨ Key Features (Assignment 3 Requirements)

### 🔗 1. External API Integration
- Uses the **GitHub REST API** to dynamically fetch and display my latest repositories.
- Includes loading states, graceful error handling, and animated GitHub cards.

### 🧠 2. Complex Application Logic
- AI Message Enhancer (Professional, Friendly, Concise, Grammar Fix)
- Smooth scrolling and fade-in animations using IntersectionObserver
- Name personalization modal with greeting updates
- Real-time session timer
- GitHub repo reload button
- Contact form validation with interactive notifications

### 💾 3. State Management
- Stores visitor name in `localStorage`
- Saves theme preference (light/dark)
- Maintains UI states even after refresh
- Modal visibility logic based on stored values

### 🚀 4. Performance Optimization
- Deferred JavaScript execution (`<script defer>`)
- Image compression for hero/projects images
- Lazy rendering using IntersectionObserver
- Cached DOM elements for faster lookups
- Removed unused CSS and minimized repetitive blocks
- Efficient API request handling (limit to 6 repos)
- Browser performance logged on page load

Result: **Page loads in under 3 seconds** on typical devices.

### 🤖 5. AI Innovation
AI tools supported development by:
- Improving logic structure
- Suggesting design refinements
- Debugging DOM/event issues
- Optimizing performance
- Assisting in documentation writing
